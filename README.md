Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Dislikes Dataset

Description:
In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the YouTube Dislikes Dataset, focusing on trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021 in the USA, Canada, and Great Britain. The dataset contains valuable information such as video titles, channel IDs, publication dates, view counts, likes, dislikes, comments, and more. By leveraging numpy and pandas libraries, I performed various data analysis tasks to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

Key Objectives:

Import required libraries and read the provided dataset.
Investigate the data types and shape of the dataset.
Handle missing values by dropping or imputing them.
Explore the statistical summary of numerical and categorical columns.
Convert the 'published_at' column to pandas datetime.
Create a new column 'published_month' to extract the months from the publication dates.
Replace numerical months with their corresponding names.
Analyze the number of videos published each month.
Determine the count of unique video IDs, channel IDs, and channel titles.
Identify the top 10 and bottom 10 channels based on the number of videos.
Determine the video with the maximum and minimum number of likes.
Identify the video with the maximum and minimum number of dislikes.
Explore the relationship between views and dislikes using metrics and plots.
Display information about videos published in January and mention the count of videos.
This project provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of YouTube videos, contributing to a deeper understanding of user engagement and preferences in the social media domain.
